# Build a Mario Game Controller
In this lab we will build a game controller. We'll use it to control a Mario character.

### Step 1: Build the circuit
Our Game Controller will use the following parts:
- One or more push buttons
- A 10KΩ resistor for each push button
- Jumper wires   

Use the picture below to make sure you are using correct 10KΩ resistor.

Use the following circuit diagram to construct the circuit. The direction of the photoresistor and the 10KΩ resistor is unimportant.

### Step 2: Test the circuit
TBD

### Step 3: Download the artwork for the Mario game
Right click [`MarioBase.sb`](MarioBase.sb) and choose *Save link as. . .*. Save the file to your *Scratch Projects* folder in your *Documents* folder. Open the S4a program and then choose *File | Open* and browse to and select `MarioBase.sb`.

### Step 3: Write the program
TBD

### Step 4: Submit your finished program
Have your teacher or a TA verify that you have a working program. Submit your finished program by uploading the .sb file to Google classroom. You should be able to find it in *My Documents | Scratch Projects*. If you worked with a partner, each partner should submit a copy of the finished program to Google classroom.
