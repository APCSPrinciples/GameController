# Build a Mario Game Controller
In this lab we will build a game controller for a Mario game. Since this is a large project, we'll complete it in four parts:
1. Make Mario jump when a button is pushed
2. Add two more buttons so that Mario can also walk left and right
3. If Mario jumps on top of Goomba, then Goomba is "squished"
4. If Goomba touches Mario the game ends

### Step 1: Build a circuit with one button that can make Mario jump
Our Game Controller will use the following parts:
- Three (or more) push buttons
- A 10KΩ resistor for each push button
- Jumper wires   

Use the picture below to make sure you are using correct 10KΩ resistor.

Use the following circuit diagram to construct a circuit with one push button. The direction of the 10KΩ resistor is unimportant.

### Step 2: Test the circuit
TBD

### Step 3: Download the artwork for the Mario game and open it in S4A
Right click [`MarioBase.sb`](MarioBase.sb) and choose *Save link as*. Save the file to your *Scratch Projects* folder in your *Documents* folder. Open the S4a program and then choose *File | Open* and browse to and select `MarioBase.sb`.

### Step 3: Write the program
TBD

### Step 4: Submit your finished program
Have your teacher or a TA verify that you have a working program. Submit your finished program by uploading the .sb file to Google classroom. You should be able to find it in *My Documents | Scratch Projects*. If you worked with a partner, each partner should submit a copy of the finished program to Google classroom.
